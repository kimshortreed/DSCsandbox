- Pre-workshop activities: 10 min 
- Introductory presentation: 10 min
- Hands-on activities: 60 min

## What is _Inkscape_? 

_Inkscape_ is a **free** and open source graphics editor that has a number of features to help you to **produce your own art and promotional materials like logos, posters, illustrations, typography, flow charts, and more.** 

## When to use _Inkscape_ vs. other graphics programs 

_Inkscape_ is a **free** and open source graphics editor that has a number of features to help you to **produce your own art and promotional materials like logos, posters, illustrations, typography, flow charts, and more.** 

The following table lists some popular graphic-design tools and their _general_ use:

| Software name | Purpose | Cost |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **[Inkscape (↪)](https://inkscape.org/)** | logos of any size, printable documents (posters, brochures, and flyers), digital art, diagrams, marketing materials for web and print  | Free |
| **[GIMP (↪)](https://www.gimp.org/)** (Gnu Image Manipulation Program) | photography and image manipulation, such as image optimization, colour and contrast editing, cropping, scaling, combining, and conversion (like changing a .png to .jpg) and many of the tools and features found in Adobe _Photoshop_. **Checkout our GIMP workshop: [Intro to Image Editing with GIMP (↪)](https://libcal.uvic.ca/calendar/dsc/gimp)**| Free |
| **[Photopea (↪)](https://www.photopea.com/)** | a free, online (no software installation required) photo editor which looks a lot like _Photoshop_ and has many of the same tools. Photopea is great for beginners. The free (ad-supported) version gives you up to 500mb of storage. Photopea also connects to Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive. There is a paid version that gives you more storage and removes the ads. | Free & Paid (roughly 4.50 CDN per month)|
| **[Photoshop (↪)](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop.html)** | photography and image manipulation, like GIMP, but used by professional photographers  | roughly 30 CDN per month |
| **[Illustrator (↪)](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/illustrator.html)** | a vector-graphics program like _Inkscape_, but considered industry-standard for professional designers  | roughly 30 CDN per month |

## How do I choose? 
With so [many other graphic-design tools out there (↪)](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-graphic-design-software), it can feel difficult to choose. 

One way to think about it is to ask yourself what you're trying to do and how much time you're willing to invest in learning a particular software. For example, if you make the occasional poster or brochure, then _Inkscape_ should be fine for your design-needs, but if you're exploring a career in graphic design, then you will eventually want to try _Photoshop_ and _Illustrator_. Although, some professionals prefer _Inkscape_ and some amateurs prefer _Illustrator_. 

## Why _Inkscape_? 

Like _Illustrator_, _Inkscape_ edits and exports standardized [scalable vector graphics (.svg) format (↪)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). An SVG file is a type of image-file format that allows for unlimited sized images that still look sharp, no matter how big they are. 

"Raster graphics," in file formats like .jpg and .png, lose resolution and look pixelated when scaled up, but SVG files do not. _Inkscape_ is a great choice for creations like poster boards, flyers, or even large-scale signs for brick-and-mortar businesses. 

_Inkscape_ can import, combine, and export images and files in a number of popular formats, including SVG, AI, EPS, PNG, PS and PDF. You could design a poster, export it as a PDF and get it printed at a local printshop. Or, you could use _Inkscape_ to make a [wireframe (↪)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) for your next website, and so much more. 

One big advantage for _Inkscape_ is that this **a free program** with a wealth of available tutorials on the Internet and Youtube.

## Learning objectives

This workshop introduces you to working in _Inkscape_ and provides a few basic tutorials to help you get there.

Depending on how many of our _Inkscape_ tutorials you complete, by the end of this workshop you will be able to do the following:

* Describe situations where using _Inkscape_ is preferable to other graphics programs
* Describe and locate some key tools in the _Inkscape_ tool library
* Use or be familiar with the following _Inkscape_ tools: 
  * align and distribute
  * guides
  * layers
  * text boxes
  * colour picker
  * canvas options
* Import and convert a raster image, like a .jpg or .png file, into an SVG file using the "bitmap tracer" tool
* Describe and edit nodes
* Import and export files

## The _Inkscape_ bonus: learning crossover
All graphic-design softwares share some basic similarities, like the use of layers, grids, and rulers, and tools to draw, manipulate, and edit images on a canvas.

**By doing this _Inkscape_ workshop you will learn helpful principles that crossover into other graphics programs!**

## Background and practice 

You will notice that many of the tutorials in this workshop are divided into separate sections: **background** and **practice**. 

The background sections teach you the "why" and the practice sections teach you the "how." Put another way, the background sections provide context for why we are doing something, while the practice sections walk you through steps that you can practice on your own. 

The practice sections will also include **tips** that you might find helpful, especially if you are new to working with graphic design programs.

Allow yourself to have fun with this process. **You can't "break" anything and you can always hit Ctrl + Z (or Command + Z for macOS) to undo whatever you last did.** 

## Choose your own Inkscape adventure!

**This workshop will begin with a look at _Inkscape_'s interface and then show you how to do the basics**, like draw some simple shapes, and use the **Selector** tool to move and scale objects. 

After your introduction to the _Inkscape_ interface you can choose what you want to do from a number of short tutorials, which you can complete in whatever order you like. Feel free to return to this online workshop after the session is over.

Have fun, and please ask for assistance any time.

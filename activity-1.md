# Installing _Inkscape_ and Introducing its Interface

If you have not already sone so, please complete the [the pre-workshop section](#) before doing this tutorial. 

Now it is time to install _Inkscape_ on your computer. **Note that this tutorial is for _Inkscape_ 1.2.** 

Please ask for assistance if you run into any snags. Here we go! 

## 1. Download and install _Inkscape_

### Background
- When you install _Inkscape_, you will be walked through a few choices to make prior to opening the program for the first time. 
- We will click through the suggested options and make only one change, which is setting the theme to "Light" mode, mostly because it will be easier to see the tutorial images. 
- The images in this tutorial might look slightly different than what you see in your version of _Inkscape_, depending on your system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). 
- _Inkscape_ takes up roughy 600MB of space on your hard drive. 

### Practice
**1.1.** **Go to [inkscape.org (↪)](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.2.1/) and install the correct version** of _Inkscape_ for your operating system (macOs, Windows, or Linux).

**1.4.** In the "Time to Draw" window, click **New Document**.

You should now see a blank page in _Inkscape_'s main interface, which should look something like this example (macOS version):

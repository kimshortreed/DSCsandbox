# Land acknowledgement

We acknowledge the Indigenous lands where we are located.    

We acknowledge and respect the [lək̓ʷəŋən People](https://www.songheesnation.ca/community/l-k-ng-n-traditional-territory) on whose traditional territory the university stands and the Songhees, Esquimalt and [W̱SÁNEĆ People](https://wsanec.com/history-territory/) Peoples, whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day.
